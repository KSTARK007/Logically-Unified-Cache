# Logically Unified Cache (LUC) - Artifact


## Implementation Components

This repository contains the implementations discussed in the paper:

### CRAQ-KV
A strongly consistent key-value store implementing the CRAQ (Chain Replication) protocol.

**→ [CRAQ-KV Implementation](CRAQ-KV/)**

### TWIG-KV  
An eventually consistent key-value store using primary-backup replication.

**→ [TWIG-KV Implementation](TWIG-KV/)**

### LUC-RethinkDB
Integration of LUC architecture with RethinkDB, a production database system.

**→ [LUC-RethinkDB Implementation](LUC-RethinkDB/)**

### LUC-Sim
A high-performance cache simulation framework for evaluating LUC's performance under various workloads and configurations.

**→ [LUC-Sim Implementation](LUC-Sim/)**
